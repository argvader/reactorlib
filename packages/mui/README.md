# Reactor Library - Material UI Extension

Reactor Library simplifies React/Redux development, minimizing the boilerplate required to get the job done.

Here are things that Reactor Library can help you work with:

- Functional Components (state, _effects_)
- Declarative Routing
- Simplified App State (fresh take on Redux)
- Context

This expansion package adds convenience functions to help you integrate **[Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)** into your project more easily. Among others it automatically sets up the following:
- CSS baseline
- Theme provider
- Additional JSS presets (e.g. [jss-expand](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss-expand))
