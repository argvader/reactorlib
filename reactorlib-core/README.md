# Reactor Library

Reactor Library simplifies React/Redux development, minimizing the required boilerplate to get the job done.

Here are things that Reactor Library can help you work with:

- Functional Components (state, _effects_)
- Declarative Routing
- Simplified App State (fresh take on Redux)
- Context
